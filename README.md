# Credit Risk Analysis

Credit Cards, Credit Score, Credit Limits, the list goes on! Your credit is important, and analysis of credit is also very important. Through the use of Machine Learning it was taked to assess several machine learning tests in regards to Credit Card Risk. Using libraries such as imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn, as well as aalgorithms such as RandomOverSample and SMOTE, machine models were trained to assess Credit Card Risk to determine which model gave the best results. 

# Results

Balance and Accuracy scores were assessed for six machine learning models in our analysis of Credit Risk Analysis. The first machine learning models were on Resampling.

The first step taken was splitting the data into features and targets. For the purpose of this analysis the focus was on "Loan Status." From basic assessments it was found that there are 347 high risk credit accounts. Through the machine learning with train test splits, the high risk account numbers went from 347 to 260 (as shown above).
